\section*{Introduction}

The Internet is a web of thousands of interconnected networks, called Autonomous
Systems (AS). ASes are collections of routers with a coherent routing policy
controlled by a single administrative entity or domain (such as an Internet
service provider (ISP), a university, or a large company) and represent
connected groups of blocks of IP addresses, called IP prefixes. These IP address
aggregations determine the common path to each contained IP address within the
different networks.

\noindent ASes use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to establish connections
between each other. With BGP update messages an AS can announce changes in the
local database, advertise its IP prefix to neighboring ASes, and notify them of
new ``best'' (e.g. shortest) routes to other ASes on the Internet. These updates
are also used to withdraw old paths.

\section*{Prefix Hijacking and Outages}
However, any AS can also claim to own someone else's IP prefix and thereby
create invalid routes, either by misconfiguration or attacks, as happened in
2008 when Pakistan Telecom announced a prefix belonging to YouTube so that
YouTube's traffic was hijacked on a global scale.

\captionof{figure}{
Pakistan Telecom announced a more specific route than the one that was announced
previously by YouTube. Now most of the traffic would be redirected to the wrong
AS.
}
\end{center}\vspace{1cm}

\noindent While the damage in this case was only the loss of YouTube's
reachability and therefore quite easy to detect, other types of hijacking might
be even more serious than short outages. It is conceivable that the attacker
successfully masquerades as the real prefix owner or forwards the hijacked
traffic to the true destination while capturing all the transmitted data without
letting the victims know their traffic was diverted.

\section*{Securing BGP}

Since BGP itself lacks protection against such attacks (or just configuration
mistakes), a Resource Certification (RPKI) was developed on top of open
standards from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to validate the prefix
origin and secure this routing infrastructure. The holder of an address space
can authorize ASes to rightfully originate prefixes from this space so that the
prefix of each BGP update can be verified for origin validity before it is added
to the route decision process.

\section*{BGP Data Collection}

There are different projects that gather BGP data from locations around the
world since 1997 and make it publicly available along with several tools to
monitor this data in almost real-time, analyze the historic development, or
academic research. Measuring BGP data is important to gain understanding about
structure and dynamics of the BGP ecosystem and the infrastructure of the
Internet.

The \emph{RouteViews} project deploys 17 BGP route collectors worldwide and
archives the collected data continuously.
}
\end{center}\vspace{1cm}


\section*{Monitoring BGP Traffic}

With this data and tools available we can monitor and visualize BGP traffic with
regard to origin and path changes, new prefix announcements, or withdrawals and
allow a better understanding of routing decisions and disruptions.

\noindent In particular, using RPKI, it's possible to verify origins of IP
prefixes and compile statistics on prefix hijacking or incorrectly configured
attestations about authorized route announcements. Our tests have shown that
today at least up to 10 percent of monitored prefixes with an upward trend in
this manner can be validated with RPKI.
